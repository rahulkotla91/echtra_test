Tools that I have used and why?
I have used shell scripting for automation and Docker for virtualization purposes. I chose Shell over other scripting languages because shell has simpler notations for text processing, file handling, piping compared to other scripting languages. Shell makes common and simple actions very simple at the expense of making complex things more complex. For this project text processing, file handling, docker virtaulization are three main steps which can be handled with shell efficiently so I chose Shell.
I used docker for virtualization. Server spin up is more faster and efficient using docker because virtual machines has complete os with its memory management installed but where as docker containers are executed using docker engine which runs by sharing host's kernel.So for this application I used docker for server spin up.
